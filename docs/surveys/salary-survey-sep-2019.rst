Salary Survey: September 2019
=============================

We're excited to launch our first ever survey,
a Salary Survey.

Our goal is to help people understand the pay scales and benefits in the software industry around documentation.
This will help people get a better understanding of what an appropriate salary is,
and then negotiate for a better one.

The survey is 21 questions broken up into 4 parts.
Please go ahead and fill it out here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wtd-salary-2019

The salary will be open until **October 31st, 2019**,
after that we will process the data and publish the anonymized results.
