By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

We work hard to keep ticket prices affordable for a broad range of attendees.
Your sponsorship makes it possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events,
whether they're a freelancer, a student or out of work.
Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your commitment to and support of good documentation,
and the people who build it.
