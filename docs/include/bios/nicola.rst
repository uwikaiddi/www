Nicola has spent much of her life wearing various hats for Melbourne's internet
startups: programmer, QA, BA, PM and other acronyms. Now she's the Communications
Manager for FastMail, helping people to help themselves. Technology is useless
if nobody knows how to use it! She's overly fond of bad puns, because word jokes
are the best. One day she will transform into a ninja-pirate-unicorn but that
day has not yet come.
