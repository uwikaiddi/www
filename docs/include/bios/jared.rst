Jared has been a Technical Writer for about 10 years now, and is back in the
Tech Writing game again after a two-year Product Management sabbatical. When he's
not helping organisations plan and deliver documentation as a product, he co-hosts
the Write the Docs and BlahCade Pinball Podcasts, and restores pinball machines
to their former glory.
