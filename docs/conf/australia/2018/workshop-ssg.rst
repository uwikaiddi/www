Workshop: Static Site Generators, What, Why and How!
=====================================================

As many documentation teams move towards a docs-as-code workflow, most are
turning to static site generators like Sphinx, Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby to turn
that "code" into user-facing documentation websites.

In this mini-workshop, you’ll get an introduction to the static site generator
landscape, and apply what you learn by publishing your own site in class.

We’ll cover:

- How static site generators work

- Comparison of popular generators, with guidelines for choosing one for your next project

- Hands-on editing and publishing of your own statically generated portfolio website
