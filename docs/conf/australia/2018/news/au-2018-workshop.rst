Announcing Details of Workshop: Tech Writing 101
=================================================

We're delighted to announce the details of a **Tech Writing 101** workshop
as part of the *Write the Docs Australia 2018* conference!

Operations manuals, design docs, code comments, email messages, post mortems...
writing things down for others is an unavoidable part of the life of an
engineer, a UX designer, a product manager, and, of course, a tech writer.

The workshop leads you through a series of pair-work exercises to improve the
clarity, readability, and effectiveness of your writing. You'll learn from an
experienced Google technical writer and from each other.

By the end of the session you'll also think differently about toothbrushes.

Before attending the workshop, you need to do a small amount of pre-reading
(~30 minutes reading about basic technical writing concepts):

During the workshop, you'll apply the principles youâ€™ve read in the prework.
We've found this method of learning is highly effective. And it's just plain
fun. The workshop has been run at SREcon in Europe 2017 and at SREcon in the US
in 2018, where it was very well received. People said they came away with
useful skills and cleaner teeth.

We hope you'll join us in Melbourne, Australia for the conference and for this
exciting workshop, where you'll learn something new about toothbrushes or at
least how to write about them.
