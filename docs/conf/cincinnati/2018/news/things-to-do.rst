A Few Things to Do Around the Venue
===================================

Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati is this weekend!
We're looking forward to seeing everybody Saturday morning.
For those arriving early Friday,
we've put together a list of things to do in Cincinnati near the venue.
All of these places are easy to reach on the `streetcar <https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/streetcar/>`_.

Ohio Riverfront
---------------

From `Smale Riverfront Park <http://www.cincinnatiparks.com/smale-riverfront-park/>`_
to `International Friendship Park <http://www.cincinnatiparks.com/river-parks/theodore-m-berry-international-friendship-park/>`_,
two miles of the Cincinnati riverfront are parks and public spaces.
Climb into the flying pig at Smale Park,
and cross the Ohio River on the Roebling Bridge or the Purple People Bridge.


Cincinnati Reds
---------------

For baseball fans, catch a `Reds <https://www.mlb.com/reds>`_ game at the Great American Ballpark on the banks of the Ohio River.
Arrive early to visit the `Reds Hall of Fame & Museum <http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/cin/hof/>`_.

Parks and Music
---------------

Visit `Fountain Square <https://myfountainsquare.com/>`_ in the heart of downtown,
or head closer to the venue for `Washington Park <https://washingtonpark.org/park-rules/>`_
and a view of the historic `Music Hall <https://www.cincinnatiarts.org/music-hall>`_.
Both Fountain Square and Washington Park have free live music Friday evening.

Museums
-------

Museum fans can check out
the `National Underground Railroad Freedom Center <http://www.freedomcenter.org/>`_,
the `Taft Museum of Art <https://www.taftmuseum.org/>`_,
the `Contemporary Arts Center <https://www.contemporaryartscenter.org/>`_,
and the `Cincinnati Fire Museum <https://www.cincyfiremuseum.com/>`_.

A short bus ride away is the `Cincinnati Museum Center <https://www.cincymuseum.org/>`_
at `Union Terminal <http://myunionterminal.com/>`_,
the architectural inspiration for the `Hall of Justice <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Justice_(comics)>`_.
Unfortunately, it is currently undergoing renovations, so most exhibits are closed.

Findlay Market
--------------

Foodies should plan a visit to `Findlay Market <http://www.findlaymarket.org/>`_,
the oldest continually operating public market in Ohio.

Games and Drinks
----------------

If you'd rather sit inside and have some fun,
check out `16-Bit Bar+Arcade <http://www.16-bitbar.com/cincy>`_, a bar with arcade games,
or `The Rook OTR <http://therookotr.com/>`_, a bar with board games.
Both 16-Bit and The Rook are a short walk from the conference venue.
