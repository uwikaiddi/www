About the Venue
===============

Our venue is `Union Hall`_ at 1311 Vine Street in Cincinnati.
Union Hall is a nineteenth-century beer hall that has been given new life as a coworking space and technology accelerator.
The venue is in Cincinnatiâ€™s historic Over the Rhine neighborhood,
easily walkable, connected to downtown, and surrounded by restaurants and entertainment.
Union Hall is a short walk to two stops of the Cincinnati streetcar, a three-mile loop through downtown and Over the Rhine that connects the riverfront, hotels, restaurants, and major Cincinnati landmarks.

While visiting, guests are free to use any of the open coworking space.
Please do not use the conference or huddle rooms without booking them.
Guests may also use kitchens on the first, second, and fourth floors.
