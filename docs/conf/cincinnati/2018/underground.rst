Underground Tour
================

Join us after the unconference on Sunday for a private `Queen City Underground Tour <https://www.americanlegacytours.com/queen-city-underground/>`_.
This walking tour of Cincinnati's historic Over the Rhine neighborhood takes
you into a crypt where some of Cincinnati's first resident are buried
and into the lagering tunnels of a 19th century brewery.
Our private tour will also provide some history on our venue, Union Hall,
which is no longer available on the public underground tours.

This tour requires a significant amount of walking, including up and down steep stairs.

This is a separately ticketed tour and costs $30 per person.
