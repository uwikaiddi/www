**“Deliver the right information to the right person at the right time in the right language and format on the device of the customer’s choosing.” - Scott Abel**

**How does this typically play out where you work?**

* **Maria Nedelcu-** In general, we follow this principle, but it is very hard to do so with 10+ products that update simultaneously.

  * **right information:** we always check with SMEs the information we provide. each product has its set of guides even though many features are common. (we think to change this with more granular docs, as they do not scale well now)
  * **right person:** each user role has its set of guides
  * **at the right time:** documentation is delivered with each product release, even more often than that (bug fixes)
  * **right language:** documentation is localized in the supported languages. Localizations are most times behind because of the lack of time till the release. We're working on a process improvement
  * **right format:** Not at the moment. We prepare the new documentation portal, which will be in the right format.

**Considering comments from several of us about how common it is to look up info on the Internet, Baker's premise is that:**

  *All content is consumed in the context of the Web. ...Today we live, work, and read in the context of the Web.*

**Do you agree or disagree?**

* **Daryl White-** I think it is also *consumed* in the context of the web, though. Even if I am at the cinema with my phone off, I'm usually looking stuff up on my phone on the way back to my car. And for the technical writing perspective, I think it is important to remember that our users will turn to the Internet before, during, or after our docs - even if our docs are not web based or are behind a paywall. They are going to look for forums, LinkedIn posts, reviews, or whatever else might help them solve their problem or find their answer.

* **Andrea Altenburg-** I totally agree. I remember when going online meant waiting for the dialup connection and having to physically be online for a specific time frame. Now, We walk into stores and the music over the speaker is sometimes from a streaming online service and everything is done over the cloud so we are never really offline unless we specifically make an effort to not be online (camping, remote areas, etc)

* **Kyle Rollins-** While I think this is true for many people, it's not true for everyone. Many of our clients' (healthcare and government) employees have restricted access to the internet. Some of them demand PDF documents for that reason. And they're not exactly outliers. Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States.

**The first concept Baker introduces in chapter 1 is that of "Information Foraging" which he illustrates**

  *Just as wild animals follow patterns that allow them to find adequate nutrition with the minimum expenditure of calories, information seekers follow patterns that allow them to find adequate information with the minimum expenditure of mental energy.*

**He goes on to pair this with a metaphor of information scent where searchers look for good trails of information and quickly move on when the scent is weak.**

**In your own information gathering (for whatever you need to know more about beyond your docs or products), how do you experience the information hunt of a forager?**

* **Maria Nedelcu-** it depends on the case. sometimes I gather all I can find about the subject and then filter out. sometimes I only look at the first search results after which I "ask a friend", aka the community or support.

* **Mandy Kinne-** I've had to forage a lot for technical information about specific product or tech lately. The information scent is weak when I stumble across marketing information, which usually isn't helpful to me, and strong if I can actually get to product documentation or info authored by an expert. Wikipedia and a company web site are usually a good starting points, but I also paid for a Medium subscription for information-rich posts.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Two suggestions for an information foraging environment are**

  1. Make it look *nutritious* (that is, contain what the user needs)
  2. Make it an *easy catch* (that is, easy to find and obtain)

**How do these ideas impact your doc design?**

* **Deborah Bernard-** So I was mulling over all this last night and realised my own information foraging involves quite a lot of browsing. It varies depending on the info I need, but I don't always reach for search first (especially docs search boxes), partly because I don't always know what precise term I'm searching for. And I think this is reflected in how I structure docs - I place a high emphasis on browseability.
* **Maria Nedelcu-** 3. make it look delicious (that is, easy to read topic text)
* **Allan Duquette-** I try to make my doc nutritious by providing everything I can think of with regards to a feature in a topic (add/edit/delete/navigate/limitations), then try to make it an easy catch by adding as many variations of a search term in the description to give it more SEO goodness. Also, I add a ToC at the top to allow people to reach their chosen parts without having to navigate through everything. Now that I read this book, this may need to be re-thought. Our search engine on our help site is generally great, but having to find those search terms afterward may be discouraging.

**The book describes two models for decision-making:**

  - The consequence model (if I do x, something good/bad will happen.)
  - The identity model (if I \do_x_, it says y about me)

**While Baker continues that tech writers don’t really follow the consequence model with documentation, do you feel that’s true?**

* **Jonathan Ortiz-Sonnen-** iirc, the context of that quote is that he’s addressing why those who create technical documentation write books instead of producing other forms of content. I’ve never produced documentation in the pre-EPPO world, so exactly 0% of my identity is tied up with being a writer of books  But for me, I think the struggle is less about how I identify, and more about “when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail”
  For example, I am the only one at my org who contributes to the user-facing developer documentation, but that’s not the only place customers go for information (we also have an FAQ forum, a community forum, GitHub repositories with sample projects, a blog where we can publish tutorials, a YouTube channel, and countless other channels). When I want to make information available to customers, I sometimes default to publishing it in the documentation, and stop there. It’s likely that most of what I publish should go into the documentation, but it would be more accessible if I also found ways to make that information available in other channels.
  That said, I don’t know how much of what goes on behind the scenes of my decision-making processes is available for my conscious mind to examine. I may think my decisions follow the consequence model, when in reality I’m influenced by something below the surface.

**Like it or not, our docs are not the only place people look for information. They turn to peers, competitors, and pretty much any other resource Google (Bing, DuckDuckGo) can serve up. What is your strategy for such a competitive information environment?**

* **Deborah Bernard-** There's something to be said for meeting users where they are. For stuff like APIs (where the primary users are devs), I'd maybe look at being active on StackOverflow, relevant Reddit subs and so on? Although then you risk turning those into support channels, which would be a pain.
* **Alia Michaels-** The problem with getting content through a web search is that the content may not be valid. Now this may a 'bad faith' comment, but most people don't know how to determine whether content is valid or not. This is another issue that tech writers may have to address: How to deal with 'bad' information available on the web? I know that one client tried a 'community forum' approach, but gave it up because it took too much monitoring.
* **Valerie Bailey-** We hired a Community Manager. He keeps it rolling. It is definitely a full -time position and seems to work very well. He used to be closely involved with Spiceworks so lots of experience in that area.

**Along that same thought, Baker says**

  If you want all of a person's business, you must meet all of that person's needs, even the obscure ones.

**Is it reasonable to expect documentation to meet all of the user's needs?**

* **Brian Lemke-** I think the medium of the docs will not always meet every user's need all the time. But as far as the content goes, the best you can do is understand the persona(s) of your user(s) and write the docs along those requirements.
* **Allan Duquette-** I’ve made this attempt and no, it’s not reasonable to expect documentation to meet all needs. There’s always an error you didn’t account for, a weird niche workflow, or a kludge that a user insists on using. Support should cover these initially. That said, I frequently touch base with Support and Success to find a pattern in obscure cases. If there are common themes, then I build content to account for it.
* **Kyle Rollins-** I think it's fair to follow the `Pareto principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>`_ here.
  Essentially, 20% of your content is going to be difficult to handle and take up 80% of your time.
  Does spending that much of your time on a relatively small portion of the content make sense? Maybe yes, maybe no.
* **Tom Crowley-** So even if you can meet all of a single user's needs, should you?
  I know that audience comes into play here - the better you define your audience, the more similar the needs of the users, but I think you have to be careful that one user's obscure need isn't another user's blocker.
